JUST EAT Test Automation Engineer Recruitment Test
==================================

Thank you for taking the time to do our technical test. It consists of two parts:

* [A technical test](#technical-test)
* [A few technical questions](#technical-questions)

In order to avoid bounced emails we would like you to submit your results by uploading the relevant zip file to a shared Google Drive folder. In order to obtain the URL for this folder please supply your Gmail or Google-based email address to either your agent or the JUST EAT member of staff who assigned you the test.

Please make this a **single** zip file named **{yourname}-{role-applied-for}.zip** containing:

1. a single markdown file with the answers to the technical questions
2. one folder containing the technical test

## Technical Test

JUST EAT has a website available at [http://www.just-eat.co.uk/](http://www.just-eat.co.uk/) that you can use to find takeaway restaurants in a postcode area.

The Technical test consists of 2 tasks:

1. Write the step defintions for the below scenario.

		Feature: Use the website to find restaurants
				So that I can order food
				As a hungry customer
				I want to be able to find restaurants in my area
			Scenario: Search for restaurants in an area
				Given I want food in "AR51"
				When I search for restaurants
				Then I should see some restaurants in "AR51"

2. Add  two more scenarios, with corresponding step definitions, which you feel would enhance the test coverage of the site.

### Platform Choice

You can create step definitions using any language of framework you are experienced with

### Task requirements

Feel free to spend as much or as little time on the exercise as you like as long as the following requirements have been met.  

- Please complete the two tasks decribed above.
- You should provide clear instructions on your test setup and how to execute your tests. The clarity and precision of these instructions - and the ease with which the interviewers can execute them - will be a key part of the assessment. Please create a README file detailing said instructions. Please also use this file for listing any additional comments or observations you might want to share about your submission.

# Technical questions

Please answer the following questions in a markdown file called `Answers to technical questions.md`.

1. How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
